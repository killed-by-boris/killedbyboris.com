#### Boris's Government didn't

### Aren't Other Conservatives also to blame?

**Yes**, many other Conservatives, including Jeremy Hunt & Priti Patel, are also to blame.

### Isn't it easy to criticise in hindsight?

Other world leaders didn't need hindsight to do a better job than Boris.

The world has known a pandemic is coming, experts have been warning for years,

this is why [the US **had** a pandemic response team setup](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/trump-scrapped-pandemic-early-warning-program-system-before-coronavirus).

### Didn't China/WHO/etc lie?

The entire world had access to the same information coming out of China 

(delayed or otherwise), so that information clearly isn't the determining

factor in why the UK has tens of thousands more avoidable deaths.

## Not Questions

### You shouldn't politicise the pandemic

The handling of the pandemic is inherently political

* [Under-funding the NHS for a decade][NHS under-funding], **is political**

* [Blocked requests for PPE][Blocked PPE], **is political**

* [Doing noting while for weeks while the WHO (and others), advised shutdown][Did Nothing], **is political**

* [Ignoring calls from call businesses to order a shutdown and leaving them with the dilemma of going broke or staying open][Slow shutdown] ,**is political**

* [Ignoring Europe's ventilator program][Rejected Ventilators], **is political**

* [Not joining Europe wide calls about the progress of the virus][European Calls], **is political**

* [Skipping COBRA meetings][Missed COBRA Meetings] to [Go on Holiday][Holiday], **is political**

* [Failing to co-ordination companies that are offering to help][Uncoordinated] **is incompetence** (ignoring it **is political**)

* [Failing to provide staff with sufficient PPE is incompetence][No PPE], ignoring it **is political** and [blaming NHS staff], **is VERY political**

* [Not having a proper screening program at airports during the lock-down][No Screening], **is political**

* [Setting up fake NHS staff on twitter to support your policies][Fake Doctors], **is VERY political**

* [Not having a plan to end the lock-down][No Plan], is either **incompetence** or playing **political** games (possible both)

* [Pursuing a Brexit strategy that has contributed to a significant shortfall in NHS staffing](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/articles/brexit-implications-health-social-care), **is political**

I think you'll find what you mean to say is that **you don't like the person you voted for being criticised**,
well tough luck.


### Poor Boris is doing the best he can

If this is the best he can do, maybe it's time he quit and 
[applied for universal credit](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/universal-credit-claims-almost-impossible-as-more-than-500000-apply).

Nobody else could get away with being so bad at their job, 
they can keep it after negligence results in tens of thousands of avoidable deaths,
so it's about time he's held accountable for his actions (or the lack of them).
